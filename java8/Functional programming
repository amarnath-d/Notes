Comparator and Comparable Interfaces
------------------------------------
-Tipically used for sorting the objects
-Java provides certain inbuilt methods to start primitive types, arrays or wrappers.
-But to compare objects comparison need to be done by custom code, and there comes role of comparator and comparable.
 -public int compareTo(Employee emp) -- 

Built-in Functional Interfaces
----------------------------
Predicate<T> - checks conditions and returns results as boolan values - filter()
Consumer<T> - Operation taking arguments but returning nothing - forEach()
Function<T,R> - Funtions taking arguments and returning results - map()
Supplier<T> - Operations returning values to the callers. Returned values could be same or different - generate() creates infinite stream of elements
